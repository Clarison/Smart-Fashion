# Custom T-Shirt Design Generator and Recommendation Engine

## Introduction

This application allows you to generate custom T-shirt designs using OpenAI's powerful models, store them in a vector database, and create a recommendation engine that suggests T-shirt designs based on similarity in the vector space. With this tool, you can easily create unique and personalized T-shirt designs and discover new ones that match your style.

## Features

- **Custom Design Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI models to generate custom T-shirt designs based on user input or preferences.
- **Vector Database**: Stores generated T-shirt designs as vectors in a database for efficient retrieval and analysis.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests T-shirt designs similar to a given design using vector similarity in the database.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for design generation and recommendation.

## Requirements

To use this application, you need the following:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- OpenAI API access
- Libraries: numpy, OpenAI Python SDK, a database system (e.g., MongoDB)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tshirt-design-generator.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```shell
   pip install numpy openai pymongo
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API credentials by following the instructions provided by OpenAI.

4. Configure your database system (e.g., MongoDB) and update the database connection settings in the application.

## Usage

1. **Custom Design Generation**:

   - Use the OpenAI model to generate custom T-shirt designs based on user input, such as text, images, or design preferences.
   - Save the generated designs as vectors in the database, associating them with relevant metadata.

2. **Recommendation Engine**:

   - Implement a recommendation engine that calculates design similarity based on the stored vectors.
   - Given a user's design or preferences, query the database to retrieve and suggest similar T-shirt designs.

3. **User Interface**:

   - Create a user interface (e.g., a web or mobile app) that allows users to interact with the design generation and recommendation features.

4. **Analysis and Optimization**:

   - Continuously analyze user interactions and feedback to optimize the recommendation engine for better suggestions.
